# Project-Nearby-Search-Program
• Implemented a ‘Point Database’ to store the position of all the landmarks in the map using Range Tree data structure./
• Used pre‑processing to take advantage of the frequent nature of queries and the relatively static nature of landmarks./
• The program efficiently stored landmark data for fast processing of “search nearby” queries, similar to Google Maps.
